# OMR-Sentiment-Insights (Accuracy Improved + Research Paper)

## Overview

This repository contains an extended version of the original FYP titled **"OMR Based Sentiment Insights"**, developed by senior students of the department. The purpose of this work is to improve the accuracy of the existing NLP-based OMR system and support a research study on performance enhancement techniques.

This project does not aim to take credit for the original work. Instead, it builds upon the existing system by refining its accuracy, improving error handling, and providing additional evaluation for research purposes.

## Credits and Acknowledgements

The foundation of this work is based on the original Final Year Project developed by senior students:

**Title:** OMR Based Sentiment Insights
**Original Authors:** [Senior Team Names]
**Institution:** [Department / University]
**Year:** [Year of Original FYP]

We acknowledge their contribution and use their architecture and implementation as the base for this extension. This repository is intended only as an improvement of their work, not a replacement.

## Purpose of This Extension

The goals of this extended version are:

1. Improve the accuracy of the NLP-based classification.
2. Reduce misclassification errors found in the previous model.
3. Introduce more robust preprocessing and model evaluation.
4. Produce a research paper documenting the improvements.
5. Maintain transparency by crediting the original authors.

## Features Added in This Extended Version

The following enhancements are being developed:

1. Updated NLP preprocessing pipeline
2. Improved model training and hyperparameter tuning
3. New evaluation metrics and comparative testing
4. Enhanced dataset preparation and validation
5. Stability improvements and code refactoring

Further improvements will be documented during the research phase.

## Research Work

This improved version supports a research extension that focuses on:

* Performance comparison between the original and updated models
* Accuracy improvement analysis
* Error case examination
* Model behavior study on OMR-related text inputs

The research paper will follow academic standards and clearly cite both the original work and all external references.

## Project Structure

A suggested folder layout for clarity and academic transparency:

* `original_reference/` — Notes, summaries, or code excerpts (if allowed) from the senior FYP
* `preprocessing/` — Text cleaning, tokenization, normalization
* `models/` — ML/NLP models used for sentiment classification
* `evaluation/` — Accuracy tests, confusion matrices, metrics
* `research/` — Drafts, datasets used, and research-related files
* `src/` — Core project code

## How to Run

Instructions for setup (modify based on your project):

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using requirements.txt
3. Run preprocessing scripts
4. Train or load the improved model
5. Test using evaluation scripts

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python preprocess.py
python train.py
python evaluate.py
```
